# zsh-config

This is my personal repository for managing and customizing my Zsh environment using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/). It includes custom aliases, functions, and plugins tailored to my workflow, primarily focused on development tools like Git, Docker, Java, and Python.

## Features

- **Custom Aliases**: Shortcuts for common commands, especially for Git, Docker, and system management.
- **Plugins**: Enhancements for productivity, such as `git`, `mvn`, `zsh-autosuggestions`, and `fast-syntax-highlighting`.
- **Zsh Theme**: Using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for a clean and informative prompt.

Feel free to explore or adapt this configuration for your own use.

**Note**: This configuration is tailored to my personal workflow. Adjustments may be needed for your own environment.
